# Swiss Glacier Changes

This repository contains the source code for our project within the ESC 403 course in the spring semester 2022.
 
## Contents

The repository contains a `data/` directory which contains the raw data files we used in this project as well as a csv with the cleaned and pre-processed data. Furthermore, there is also a `figures/` directory where all the figures are saved for further use in our presentation. 
The script `functions.R` contains self-written functions that we use throughout our analysis whereas the script `analysis.R` contains all the source code for data import, EDA, pre-processing, visualisation and model fitting.
