# Swiss Glacier Changes

This repository contains the source code for our project within the ESC 403 course in the spring semester 2022.
 
## Contents

The repository contains a `data/` directory which contains the raw data files we used in this project as well as a csv with the cleaned and pre-processed data. Furthermore, there is also a `figures/` directory where all the figures are saved for further use in our presentation. The two scripts `eda.R` and `functions.R`contain the source code for the all the plots and the data pre-processing and exploring.
